This is an extension to connect GMail with GPT




Inbox Hero
Inbox Hero is a browser extension that helps busy users manage their emails more efficiently. It works by sending the entire thread of emails from any company or person to the ChatGPT language model when the user clicks the reply button. ChatGPT then generates an answer based on the previous emails in the thread, allowing users to easily handle their emails without having to manually copy and paste previous threads.

Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.
Click the "Add to Chrome" or "Add to Firefox" button to install the extension.
Once installed, the extension will be added to your browser's toolbar.

Privacy Policy
Inbox Hero does not store any of your email data. It only sends the email thread to ChatGPT for analysis, and the generated response is returned directly to your browser. We do not collect or store any personal information.
